FiveWordStory 生产力组件（React）
Inspiration

When people read articles, they sometimes have thought of specific words. We want to develop a widget to make these thoughts to a story.

What it does

User needs to input or choose five words to this program. After that, this widget can provide a short summary of a novel with these five keywords.

How we built it

We use two apis to generate the random words and the stories. The latter is an api of generative artificial intelligence.

Challenges we ran into

We have not any experiences in javascript, html or css before, so before we start, it is necessary to learned all thing of website development.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

As totally beginner without any hackathon experience before, we finally created a project with limited time and learned how to collaborate together.. :)

What we learned?

HTML and css format. Javascript.

Future for fiveWordStory

Users can choose the number of words and get random words in some range(noun, adjectives ..).
